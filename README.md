# Super Resolution Classification

This is a project aimed at using classification on superresolution image.

## Super Resolution GAN Model

This model aims to generate super resolution images from low resolution images.

### Weights and images

Pretrained weights and images are actually needed for the model. However, they are too large to upload to github. (to update: upload the weights and images to google drive and provide download link here) 

### Run inference on images
run
```
python infer2.py
```
will generate the high resolution images
